\chapter{Project Overview} % brief description of the whole project
The CS455 Monitor System is a network monitor system that will monitor UNA's CS network in order to help administrators identify and address potential network problems as they occur. The system will automatically collect and store data, as well as provide warnings and error messages when certain events trigger the system. However, the system will rely on administrators to see the messages and act on them; the system is \textbf{not} automated to handle the events.  The monitor systems contains four sub-systems working in tandem; agents, monitoring engine, data store, and a dashboard.
This team's focus is the data storage unit of the system which will store the data collected by the agents.

\section{Software Overview} % description of the software component this team is building
The user will never directly interact with the database. The database acts solely as a place to store collected metrics and logs. The database will be scalable to accommodate up to hundreds of active servers and a dozen active dashboards. The database system will be hosted on UNA's CS server and host data for up to a year. The data storage will take data from the monitoring system and sort it into one of two two fundamental types of data, metrics or logs. 
Metrics are numerical values that describe some aspect of a system at a particular point in time. They are lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time scenarios. Logs contain different kinds of data organized into records with different sets of properties for each type.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\chapter{Technical Approach} % this section describes the team's software engineering process
% each section describes how the named item will be managed, tracked, documented, and reported

\section{Development Process}
% process used by the team to develop the software
% including a coding standard and a secure coding standard
% may also (should include) peer code reviews
The team plans to use the standard data language Structured Query Language, specifically MySQL. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. The relational database will organizes data passed to it from the engine into one or more data tables in which data types are related to one another to structure the data. The standard SQl names and coding conventions will be used. Code will be broken into components, and each member will take responsibility for a component. 
Peer review will be periodically done by other members of the team.
Peer reviews purpose is to remove defects as early as possible in the development process. The process includes removing defects in the original documents such as the requirement and design documents, test plans and procedures.
The peer should be someone that is a technical expertise and equal standing, while the review should involve the careful judgement. The process begins with a determined scope of review.Next, a determine rigor level leading a plan to review in detail. finally, we ensure observations are resolved.
The team makes an effort of considering all requirements within reviews.Reviews are sent to the technical expertise for missed expectations once discussed by entire team. Those mistakes will be corrected every week leading to useful product.

\section{Development Tools}
% software tools, for example IDE's, compilers, test tools, static analysis, version control, etc.
The standard Windows and Linux OS terminal, build in compiler and online IDE environment's compiler will be used as development tools.

\section{COTS \& FOSS Tools}
% commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software used and open source software used in the product
% note - these create risks
% (FOSS)software that is both FREE  and OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE where anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way,
As the data storage unit will be created using the MySQL relational database management software, the main environment will be the terminal. The team will utilize the MariaDB monitor that is already available on the CS network.
MariaDB is a open-source GNU General Public License community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system, 

\section{Software Reuse}
% describes any software that was previously produced by the team that is being reused in the product
% note - these create risks
N/A

\section{Testing Process}
% describe the plan for testing the software meets requirements
% include how tests and test results are documented, tracked, and reported
The team plans to use standard SQL testing to check that the database works as it should.
blank will be done to ensure compliance with the SEI CERT style guide.
Communication and accessibility tests will be conducted first. The team will test to see if the data store can communicate with the engine and the dashboard over the network. They will also test to see if the user can interact with text forms of the data from the dashboard. Once communication and accessibility tests have been passed, testing will move forward to the next step. Information retrieval and view-ability tests will be conducted next. The team will then test to see if system administrators can retrieve information regarding CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network usage from the data store. Once information retrieval and view-ability tests have been passed, scale-ability and longevity tests will be conducted. The team will test to see if the system will be able to scale up to at least fifty servers. They will also test to see id data will be able to be stored for at least a year. Once scale-ability and longevity tests have been passed, data transfer tests and sanity checks will occur. The team will test to ensure that only valid data, not invalid data, makes it through the management engine to the data store. Once data transfer tests and sanity checks have been passed, dependability and security checks will be conducted. The team will test the fault tolerance of the system. They will also test to see if information can be be saved and sent again if the server goes down. For more detailed information, please refer to the Data Store Test Plan.
