# Data Store Read Me

The Data Store will use the MariaBD RDBS installed on the CS server for storage.

The Data Store uses two separate Python scripts for automatizing connections with the Engine and Dashboard respectively.
- Dash_to_DS.py - Handles Dashboard connection
- Engine_to_DS.py -  Handles Engine connection

Use ssh to access server, then run BOTH Dash_to_DS.py and Engine_to_DS.py.

Each script will provide diagnotics messages.
